This repository makes use of `Spring Data Rest` and `SpringDoc OpenApi` to quickly and effectively create and 
document Rest APIs whose purpose is to access database resources. For the purposes of this assessment we will be using
an in-memory H2 database in order to persist our database entities.

Please access the below URL for access to the swagger-ui in order to try out each
endpoint provided by `Spring Data Rest`.
